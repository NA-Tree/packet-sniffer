# packet-sniffer




### Known issues:

* we don't have any way to choose whether or not to output every packet
* the message of the form "Capturing (type 'stop' to pause, 'quit' to exit): 51pkt [00:05,  7.18pkt/s]" is present many times throughout the process
* we don't have a way to view all of the data coming from a specific given package
* the output for each packet is not fully formatted and looks overall unpolished
