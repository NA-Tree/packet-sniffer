# packet-sniffer


## Known issues:

* when using the port filters and a port is unkown, it will still appear

## things to do : 
1- need to make it look good--> a gui or a window that shows the outputs instead of terminal which is scary ----> priority 3 
 

4- filter the ports with no port number 
5 -  add the save the selected packet into file if user like to  save 
6- record a video of the the demonstration of the project

5 -  
to use the gui :
- click start
- select the advanced option and you should see the source port , destination port  filters
- then click apply - you will get a message box telling the filter is applied
- then you can follow the icos like click on paket for the expansions and then save or save all and it will save like csv [excel document ]
-  I am still testing it and will make edits - this is skeleton for your reference and confirmation
