# packet-sniffer


## Known issues:

* the message of the form "Capturing (type 'stop' to pause, 'quit' to exit): 51pkt [00:05,  7.18pkt/s]" is present many times throughout the process and gets annoying

* when using the port filters and a port is unkown, it will still appear

## things to do : 
1- need to make it look good--> a gui or a window that shows the outputs instead of terminal which is scary ----> priority 3 
 

4- filter the ports with no port number 
5 -
