* the message of the form "Capturing (type 'stop' to pause, 'quit' to exit): 51pkt [00:05,  7.18pkt/s]" is present many times throughout the process and gets annoying
* missing support for DNS and SMPT protocols

things to do :

1- need to make it look good--> a gui or a window that shows the outputs instead of terminal which is scary ----> priority 3 
2- check if tqdm thing ---> progress bar variable is popping up i dont need that showing up in middle ----> priority 1 ---> if useful put it on top of the gui window 
3- the detail window  fro the detail 7,8,9 printing same thing ? ---> priority 2
