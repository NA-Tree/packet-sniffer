- While running the program you can control capture with the interactive command prompt (in the same terminal):
- `start` — start/resume capturing
- `stop`  — stop/pause capturing
- `status` — show current counts
- `save filename.pcap` — write captured packets to file
- `detail N` — show packet details for captured packet index N (0-based)
- `quit`  — stop capture and exit

## Notes
- Use only on authorized networks.
- The program uses timed `sniff()` loops to allow start/stop control.
